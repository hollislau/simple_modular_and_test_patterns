# The Greeter App

## Adding gulp and package.json to the project

The greet.js file exports a Greeter constructor function. When instantiated with a name argument, it will return a greeting to the provided name. Additionally, when the file is run in node and provided with a name argument (i.e. `node greet.js Goose`), it will log a greeting to the console to the name that is provided. Tests have been written to check the instance properties and that the greet function returns the greeting as expected. Gulp has been set up to automate all linting and testing. Enter `gulp` in the command line to initiate.
