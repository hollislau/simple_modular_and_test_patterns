# Simple Modules and Testing Assignment

The greet.js file exports an object with a greeting function. When the function is executed with a name argument, it will return a greeting to the provided name. Additionally, when the file is run in node and provided with a name argument (i.e. `node greet.js Goose`), it will log a greeting to the console to the name that is provided. Tests have been written to check the instance properties and that the greet function returns the greeting as expected.
